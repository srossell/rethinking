# Studying Statistical Rethining by Richard McElreath

In this repository I reproduce, and sometimes elaborate, on the examples in the
[Statistical Rethinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) book.
There is also a [git repository](https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/tree/master/Rethinking) translating McElrearh code from R to Python,
using PyMC3.
